# Model specs

## 注意事項

- May need to call #reload after database changes.
- Lazy-executing #let vs. eager-executing #let!
- Scopes: match_array works with ActiveRecord::Relations
- Test Associations, validations: [shoulda-matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers)
- ActiveRecord test doubles: [rspec-activemodel-mocks](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-activemodel-mocks)
